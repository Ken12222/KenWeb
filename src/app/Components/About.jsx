            I'm a User Interface and Experience Designer based in Ghana and also
            a Computer Science student. I enjoy creating things that live on the
            internet, whether that be web Designs, applications UI Designs, or
            anything in between. I have been freelancing for a year now while
            studying at the Koforidua Technical University and I've manage to
            gain a decent amount of experience and valuable knowledge from all
            different kinds of fields throughout my projects/work.
